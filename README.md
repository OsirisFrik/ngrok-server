# NGROK SERVER

This is a simple ngrok server used to start ngrok and get the url by request to the server.

### Why?

I need a way to start ngrok remotely on a local server and get the url.

## Config

### Env file

```enviroment
PORT = 
NGROK_PROTO = [http/tcp]
NGROK_PORT = 
NGROK_TOKEN = 
```

### Run

```sh
yarn install

yarn start # or dev
```
